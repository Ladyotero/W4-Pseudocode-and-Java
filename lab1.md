# Problem Solving Lab 1
-Instructions:
-Calculating the Perimeter of a Rectangle (20%)
-Create a flowchart to calculate the perimeter of a rectangle given its length and width. 
rectangle
Solve for perimeter [P = 2*(L+W)] when L is length and W is width
```
Start

//initial process
input length (L)
input width (W)

//formula 
Calculate Perimeter: [P = 2*(L+W)]

//finalizing the calculation
Output Perimeter (P)

//Please see the flowchart
# flowchart

End
```


# Problem solving question 2
-Instructions
-Create a flowchart to calculate the area of a rectangle given its length and width.
```
Start

//Initial process
Measure the Lenght (l) of the rectangule.

Measure the Width (W) of the rectangule.

Multiply the lenght and width values together.

Please see the flowchart

End
```


# Problem solving question 3
-Instructions
-Create a flowchart to find the largest of 2 numbers provided by the user.
```
Start

//Initial process
def find_largest(num1, num2) :
-if num1 > num2:
-return num1

or

return num2

while True:
 -number1= float(input( Enter the first number: "))
 --number2= float(input( Enter the second number: "))

  End
  ```
